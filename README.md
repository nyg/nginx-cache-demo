# AIT â€” Web Caching Demo for Nginx

Here we demonstrate some simple web caching techniques with Nginx, namely how to use the `Cache-Control` and `ETag` HTTP headers. We also implemented asset fingerprinting in PHP for images, styles and scripts.

## Website

The website is composed of a simple PHP page which generates dynamic content. Included in that page is static content such as a banner (jpeg file), a stylesheet and Javascript file.

## Run

```sh
./run.sh
```
